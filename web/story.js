To do this, you are monitoring data from your monitoring stations, located all around the world.","\n","^All of the data looks fine, with no seismograph readings going above 0.1mm in ground displacement. The highest is near the station named FKS2005, shortly off the eastern coast of Japan. All seems well, so you take a nap.","\n","^America, 5:46 UTC ",{"#":"CLASS: time"},"\n","^You wake up from your nap irritated; you were in the middle of a good dream. Looking around, you wonder, \"What woke me up? I didn't set any alarms.\" However, you soon see a small flashing light on your dashboard, and your irritation quickly gets replaced with fear.","\n","^That flashing light can only mean one thing: an earthquake, signalled by a dangerously high reading from a seismograph.","\n","^In this case, the readings were coming from the FKS2005 station's NS montior, and glancing up, you see something terrible: ground displacement levels reaching greater than 15mm! You nearly jump off your chair in surprise. Readings like this mean that a terrible disaster is on its way, one that will end up in the history books.","\n","^Before reporting this incident, you double check the other monitors at the FK2005 station: the EW and UD monitors, and they all show the same thing: destruction is imminent.","\n","ev","str","^Continue?","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":20},{"c-0":["\n",{"->":"Intro.Japan"},{"#f":5}]}],null],"Japan":[["^Japan, 2011, 2:00 JST ",{"#":"CLASS: time"},"\n","^You are a worker in one of Japan's main nuclear facilities: Fukushima Daiichi, and are managing the operations there.
